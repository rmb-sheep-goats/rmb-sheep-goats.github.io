The Government of Canada recently announced new market access for live cattle exports to the Philippines, as well as sheep and goat genetics exports to Indonesia and the Philippines.  According to the Canadian Livestock Genetics Association, the export market of live cattle to the Philippines is estimated to be valued at USD 8 million, and exports of sheep and goat genetics to Indonesia and the Philippines add up to USD 100,000 annually. “These recent market access gains are setting the stage for deeper bilateral economic relations between Canada and the Asean region, and will contribute to our government’s goal of reaching USD 75 billion in agri-food exports by 2025,” said Lawrence MacAulay, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
